monsterstrike.py

Automatically downloads all monster images from monst.appbank.com.<br/>
If the image file already exists in the specified folder, that image is not downloaded again.<br/>
*If the program ends prematurely, the image file may not have been entirely downloaded.<br/>
monsterstrike.py won't know that and skip the file. The incomplete image file must be manually removed.*
